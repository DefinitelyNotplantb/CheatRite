# Build (Windows)
To build, clone this repository, open the solution (.sln) file and build the solution in Visual Studio under Debug x86.  
The [static library](https://github.com/escitue/BattleriteAimbot/tree/master/Core) will automatically build in your solution directory and copy headers to their appropriate folders.  
[Cheatrite](https://github.com/ih1115/CheatRite/tree/master/Hack) will build in your solution directory under the folder "binaries".

# Notes and changes
I'll try to update this as soon as I can.

#### Todo (General):
- [x] Edit controls
- [x] Automatically get screen size
- [x] Add compensation for locked and unlocked screen ([EXPERIMENTAL, READ THIS](https://github.com/ih1115/Cheatrite/blob/master/README.md#experimental))
- [x] Add correct maximum range for aimbot so it doesn't go out of game screen when using multiple monitors
- [x] Add a configuration file
- [ ] Add more smooth aim to look less suspicious
- [ ] Add aim prediction
- [ ] Draw a map overlay to the window to show location of people in FoW
- [ ] Get orb entities and draw timers on screen

#### Todo (Scripts):
- [ ] Bakko Scripts
- [ ] Thorn Scripts
- [ ] Improve Jade Scripts
- [ ] Improve Raigon Scripts
- [ ] Create signatures instead of fixed pointers such that battlerite updates do not require code change
- [ ] Find offsets for champion list (instead of entity/projectile list) containing information on champion (max and current) health, energy, and status (casting / stunned / countering / blocking).
- [ ] Find more reliable local position offset

#### Mouse Offset
Originally, you had to change the "offset", or as some of you might know, the "69" until you locked on to the enemy.  
In this version, you can simply press the + and - key on your numpad to increase and decrease the "offset". Go into a practice game versus a bot, 1v1, and press + and - until your cursor is on the character at all times.  
Right now, the offset does not save anywhere, so you will have to manually edit it everytime you reopen the game and Cheatrite.

#### Controls
Left Control Key: Enable / Disable Aimbot (enabled by default)  
Caps Lock Key: Enable / Disable Scripts (enabled by default)  
Page UP Key: Increase aimbot offset  
Page DOWN Key: Decrease aimbot offset  
Middle Mouse Button: Change offset from locked and unlocked ([EXPERIMENTAL, READ THIS](https://github.com/ih1115/Cheatrite/blob/master/README.md#experimental))

#### Using different scripts
Upon running, you can choose whatever script you wish to use.

# Run
Pretty simple to run, open Battlerite and then open Aimrite.  
Either build the solution yourself, or go to [releases](https://github.com/ih1115/CheatRite/releases) and download the latest release.

#### Game Configuration
Please set your ingame settings to minimum and disable ```accelerate input``` under ```Gameplay``` then restart the game ([Issue](https://github.com/ih1115/BattleriteAimbot/issues/7))

# Issues
Hack not working? [Issue #2](https://github.com/ih1115/CheatRite/issues/2) and [Issue #7](https://github.com/ih1115/CheatRite/issues/7)

# Experimental
Added compensation for switching from locked to unlocked camera view, however, it's a hardcoded number, not calculated in the slightest. It may be way off, or it may be on point.  
Make sure your camera is default LOCKED. When in game, press the middle mouse button to tell the aimbot to switch to unlocked camera and vice versa.  
Also change your controls in Battlerite from making camera locked and unlocked to the middle mouse button. They should work perfectly together.
